# GHS
Implementation of GHS algorithm, the MST finding algorithm for distributed networks, in java using Kompics library

Introduction
----------

This is a project developed in Distributed Systems course at University of Tehran. At first we read a graph data from an input file, make corresponding edges and nodes. Then we create a Kompics node for each graph node and run the GHS enhanced algorithm to find the MST of the graph. At each edges detected to be in MST we write it in file.

Notes
-----

In order to build the project use an IDE like InteliJ and see the output text file. You will have to delete the MST file in order to run application again so that the output remain correct.
